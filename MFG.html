<h1> Michael's Favorite Games </h1>

<h2>Counter Strike: Global Offensive</h2>
  <br>

  <h3>This game has been one of the leading first-person-shooters since the first version’s release back in 2000. In the last 18 years, the game’s mechanics have been refined up
    until today’s version, which is nearly perfect for it’s esports scene which is worth over 400 million dollars.

<h2> Overwatch </h2>
  <br>

  <h3>While this game may seem like a first-person shooter, it actually demands skills that are more suited for a MOBA. While it’s a relatively new game, it’s main esports league,
  the Overwatch League, is worth over $100 million.

<h2> Fortnite </h2>
  <br>

  <h3>There’s a huge debate among the gaming community on which of the two main battle royales, PUBG and Fortnite, are superior.
  But as someone who has clocked in over 400 hours in both of those games, I can wholeheartedly say that I greatly prefer Fortnite.
  Due to the abundance of weapons and ability to create structures to provide cover or easily transverse the terrain, which greatly reduces the randomness that plagues battle
  royale games.

  <h3> Though it may look like a cutesy visual novel, don’t let this game fool you. The entirety of the game only lasts about four hours, and it’s free,
    so I’m not going to spoil it (highly recommend you play it). After the first 1-2 hours, the game gradually shifts tones to become the psychological horror game it really is.
    Previously happy and care-free characters spiral into madness and self-harm, and the game ends with a shocking twist. Near the end, it gets extremely meta,
    and has you manipulate the program’s files to progress in the game.
